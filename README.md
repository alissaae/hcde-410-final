### hcde-410-final
My final project will plan to look at UFO sightings and if reported sightings frequency is influcened by major sci-fi movie releases. I want to look at the timing (year) location (USA) and see if there is any correlation to alien movie release dates in the US.

The influence of media on public behavior, specficially movies has been studied at length, this paper "A QUANTITATIVE, NONREACTIVE STUDY OF MASS BEHAVIOR WITH EMPHASIS ON THE CINEMA AS BEHAVIORAL CATALYST"(1981) (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2466/pr0.1981.48.3.775) digs quantitatively into the affect movies like Jaws had on shark teeth sales in curio shops and newspaper reports of shark attacks. I intend to research the same type of information via UFO sightings affected by alien movies.
